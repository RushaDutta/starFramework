    "rationale": "The feature summary explicitly states 'Security Enhancement,' which inherently implies criticality. However, the absence of concrete details (e.g., stakeholders, evidence, or impact metrics) limits the ability to justify a higher priority. Security-related features typically warrant high priority, but without additional context, the score reflects moderate urgency."
