    "rationale": "The feature has a defined scope ('Task 2') and notable dependencies ('qwqwqw'), though stakeholder details and evidence remain unspecified. The session ID ('dd3a3d50-e3f1-4cf9-8b83-e1cc1cf05e78') and facilitator involvement suggest it is tied to an active planning context. Value agreement ('qwqw') and dissent levels appear balanced, but incomplete metadata ('description', 'module', 'stakeholders') limits confidence. Prioritized based on dependency indicators and session specificity."
